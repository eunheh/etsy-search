#Etsy Search Page - "cards"

jQuery was utilized to write functions that pulled specified information from a large block of Etsy search JSON data. Template literals were written into the functions to not only pull specified data, but also to create new classes that would have otherwise have been created in HTML. The new classes were styled in a SASS, a more sophisticated CSS method of writing  styles onto the page.
