In general our clothes are baggy and will fit much larger sizes.  Everything can be custom-made, see our main web page (www.GarbTheWorld.com) for more details. \n  All items can be returned if they don&#39;t fit. (or even if you just don&#39;t like it).\n  Shoe sizes are in US Mens and Womens and EU sizes.  Turn shoes tend to be narrow, hob knob shoes are wider.

Available in your choice of over 190 different colors!\n\nMeasuring 4\u00bd x 12\u00bd\u201d, these menus are made from two layers of sturdy cardstock. A shimmering, satin ribbon wraps around the front and ties in a bow in the center. Your menu details are printed on the front in beautiful typography under your names and the date.\n\nCardstock is available in metallic and matte finishes. The matte finish is dull and flat, without shine. The metallic finish cardstocks have a shimmery, pearlescent luster. I happily send free cardstock swatches to my clients so they can see them in person, since the metallic cardstocks, especially, are difficult to interpret over the Internet. Some are silky, some are sparkly, and some are super smooth. Get me your mailing address, and I\u2019ll get some swatches in the mail for you!\n\n\n**Alternate Design Options at No Extra Cost**\n\n- Fonts and custom monogram designs: http:\/\/pennyanndesigns.com\/fonts.jpg\n\n- Paper colors: http:\/\/pennyanndesigns.com\/paper.jpg\n\n- Ribbon colors: http:\/\/pennyanndesigns.com\/ribbon.jpg\n\n\nFor reference, the specs for the menu pictured in the photos above are as follows:\nFinish: metallic\nBase Layer: Moonlight\nTop Layer: Seedpearl\nRibbon: Mauve Shadows\n\n\n\n** Bulk Discounts **\nThis price is per menu, when you order 70 or fewer. Contact me about discounts for orders of 71 menus or more. If you&#39;d like a quantity not listed in the Quantity menu, message me, and I&#39;ll send you a custom listing for your quantity.\n\n** Turnaround Options **\nBasic: within 3 weeks of purchase: included\nRush: within 2 weeks of purchase: 10% extra\nSuper Rush: within 1 week of purchase: 20% extra\n\n** Payment **\nPayment is due before I start cutting or printing. \n\n** Shipping **\nShipping is included.\n\n** Samples ** \nIf you&#39;d like to get a finished sample, you can purchase this listing. I have pre-made samples that I can usually get in the mail within a couple days. Let me know your colors, and I&#39;ll also send along some paper swatches for you to see in person.\n\n** Ready to Get Started? **\nTo get started, tell me about your colors and about how many you&#39;d like to order.

Depending on the item, you may see shipping options that include First Class, Parcel Select, Priority, or Priority Express Mail. \r\nI highly recommend the Priority Mail options. Although these services are more expensive, they are faster, safer, and come with shipping insurance (First Class and Parcel Select packages are NOT insured).\r\n\r\nGenerally, the farther you are from my studio in West Virginia, the more it will cost to ship -- particularly for items weighing over a pound or requiring oversized packaging. ***Some items may be shipped more cheaply via Flat Rate Priority Mail, and that option generally DOES NOT show up under the shipping tab...so, if you&#39;d like to know if an item is eligible for Flat Rate shipping, send me a message and I&#39;ll get back to you asap!***\r\n\r\nPACKAGE TRACKING: Nearly all items are shipped with package tracking (the exceptions are small &#39;paper&#39; items like cards, bookmarks, and unmatted prints measuring 5 by 7 or smaller -- unless you select the Priority Mail upgrade, in which case these small items DO come with a tracking number).\r\n\r\nMEDIA MAIL: Books and magazines are shipped via Media Mail, which is typically a bit slower than First Class or Priority, but these items are eligible for shipping upgrades at the buyer&#39;s request.\r\n\r\nTIMING:  If you need an item by a certain date, please contact me before making your purchase to discuss shipping options & ensure your order arrives on time.\r\n\r\nPACKAGING: I recycle and re-use packing materials whenever possible -- this sometimes includes the use of food boxes as packaging, so if you have a serious food allergy please let me know at checkout so I won&#39;t inadvertently use an inappropriate box to package your item.\r\n\r\n\r\n","policy_refunds":"Please contact me in the event of any problems and I will do my best to work with you. \r\n\r\nI am not responsible for items lost, delayed, or damaged during shipment,  but please send me a message if something happens to your order and I&#39;ll do what I can to resolve the issue.\r\nItems shipped via the Priority Mail services automatically receive shipping insurance via the US Postal Service -- if you need to file an insurance claim, let me know and I will assist you with any verification needed by the Postal Service.\r\n\r\nI do not accept returns due to &#39;buyer error&#39; (for example, if the buyer fails to read the measurements, condition, or other details which have been clearly stated in the item listing).\r\n\r\nHave you read all of the shop policies? Great! Use coupon code YESIDID10 to get 10% off your order!","policy_additional":"COMMISSIONS: I accept commissions for original artworks in a variety of media; contact me for more information.\r\n\r\nPRICING: The prices of my artworks and handicrafts are based on a rate of just ten dollars per hour of work, plus costs of supplies.

Made using the highest quality material and care to produce a unique one of a kind creation for each order. \n\nHow its made\n\nI use the best quality vegetable tanned leather which is painstakingly made over months using tannins and other ingredients that are found in vegetables.  This is a long tanning process but it avoids the use of artificial methods and keeps the leather as natural as possible.  This method is the only method that produces leather that can be artistically carved and stamped by hand.  In the making of my products all pieces start by being hand cut from a whole piece of vegetable tanned leather.  From there the piece is hand carved and stamped if a design is desired.  Dyed to whatever color or effect is desired.  Hand sewed using 100% waxed polyester thread for strength and resistance to the elements.  The edges of the leather are hand burnished using a homemade mix of waxes.  Once the item is completed it is finished with all-natural dubbin made by me that increases the water resistance and gives the leather a supple texture without sealing the pores allowing the leather to gain a beautiful patina over time.\n\nPlease remember that dying leather is an art form not a science, colors will always vary in tone and hue based on each piece of leather used.  So there will always be some variations in colors when dying leather, which adds to the uniqueness of each piece.","currency_code":"USD","is_vacation":false,"vacation_message":null,"sale_message":"Thank you for your purchase, I will make sure that I get to work on your item in a timely manner and will deliver an exceptional handmade item as you have ordered.

Priority International Shipping (6-10 business days) can range from $25 - $50 depending on your location and the weight of your package.\r\n\r\n\u2665 GENERAL SHIPPING NOTES\r\n\r\nIf your package is needed by a certain date, we ask that this be noted in your buyer notes, at which point we may recommend that you upgrade your postage in order to ensure your package arrives in time. For time-sensitive orders that are needed within two weeks, we typically recommend Priority Shipping to guarantee their arrival in time. \r\n\r\nWhile we will do everything within our power to meet your timing, simply noting your event date in your buyer notes does not necessarily guarantee arrival by that date, as we do count on customers reviewing our shipping policies (also found in each listing description) before purchasing to confirm that they have selected the appropriate shipping method that will ensure that their package arrives before their event.\r\n\r\nWe print our shipping labels directly from your receipt, and rely on customers to review and confirm their ship-to address before placing an order. Please double-check your shipping address during the check-out process. Unfortunately we cannot be held responsible for old or incorrect addresses provided by the customer. \r\n\r\nWe are also not responsible for items that arrive after the date of your event if you decide against upgrading your shipping, or place an order without informing us of your event date. \r\n\r\nShould you be concerned that your package has become lost in transit or mis-delivered, please notify us and we will inquire with the postal carrier about its status. Though it is rare, if your package has indeed been lost in transit due to a fault of the postal carrier, please contact us and we will either issue you a refund or a store credit.\r\n\r\nIf you have any further questions on shipping or timing, feel free to contact us directly and we would be happy help!","policy_refunds":"We want you to be absolutely delighted with your purchase! If for some reason the items you receive fall short of your expectations, please contact us directly so we can make it right. \r\n\r\nChange your mind? Simply return your item(s) to us and we will issue a refund after receiving your items in their original condition. \r\n\r\nDue to their handmade nature, custom-written orders may not be returned unless there is an issue due to our error.\r\n\r\nFor any items returned to us after 60 days, a $5 re-stocking fee will apply, which will be deducted from your refund amount. For transactions placed through PayPal, we are unfortunately unable to issue a refund (in whole, or in part) after 60 days. In this case, a shop credit may be offered, depending on the circumstances. \r\n\r\nThough it is rare, if your package has been lost in transit due to a fault of the postal carrier, please contact us and we will either ship a replacement, or issue you a refund.\r\n\r\nPlease note that we cannot be held responsible for orders which arrive after your event due to a last-minute order or inadequate shipping. Please see our shipping policies for details on the optional shipping upgrades we offer.\r\n\r\nFor custom-designed items or printable files which have already been downloaded, we are unable to accept refunds.\r\n\r\nWhile we do our best to represent our products accurately in our listing photographs, please understand that the colors do vary between computer monitors. The printed products you receive should be quite close to what is depicted in our photographs, with some degree of variation to be expected depending in your monitor.\r\n","policy_additional":"Frequently Asked Questions\n\n\u2665 Are your products available for wholesale purchase?\nYes! Please contact us at  wholesale@ inklingspaperie.com to learn more about Inklings Wholesale and to tell us a bit more about your shop!\n\n\u2665 Can I have a different number of winners?\nWe can absolutely customize your order to include the exact number of winners in total that you need. If you&#39;re ordering a standard quantity in our shop (increments 12 or 24), all you need to do is let us know how many winners you&#39;d like in your buyer notes. The remaining cards will be non-winners. We package the winning cards separately for you to shuffle in.\n\n\u2665 Can you customize the wording and\/or the colors on your cards?\nUnfortunately at this time, the cards are only offered as shown. We have our cards professionally printed using a special process. This also allows us to offer products that are printed with soy-based inks on paper made from sustainably harvested trees! This process however prevents us from being able to alter the designs or print custom colors at this time. Sorry to disappoint!\n\n\u2665 Can you print a Printable Collection download for me?\nAt this time, we only offer our collections as printable files. We find that offering them as an instant download makes them much more affordable, and gives you the option to either have them printed at a local print shop, or on your home printer. The files include detailed instructions on printing and assembly for your convenience. \n\n\u2665 Which (scratch-off) cards are the winners?\n24-packs come standard with three (3) winners. We package winning cards in their own clear cellophane envelope. You should find this at the back of your stack of cards, within the larger plastic pillow envelope. If you purchased a large quantity of cards, your winning cards should be located within just one of the envelopes you received. 12-packs come standard with one (1) winner, which is located at the top of your stack of cards. If you&#39;ve already shuffled your cards, contact us. In most cases, we have built a small &quot;tell&quot; in the winning cards to allow you to differentiate them!\n\n\u2665 What are all of the Bachelorette Dares? \nWe designed this game to offer a fun game with just the right amount of spice without next-day regrets. Each of the dares can also be interpreted as you see fit, so &quot;kiss a stranger&quot; could simply be a peck on the cheek if you prefer. Here are the dares:\n\n- Get a stranger to serenade the bride!\n- Take a picture with the DJ or Bartender\n- Take a picture with a guy who has the same name as the groom\n- Do the chicken dance in the middle of the room\n- Get a buck from a guy\n- Kiss a stranger\n- Switch outfits with someone\n- Find someone to buy the bride a drink\n- Get a guy&#39;s phone number on a napkin\n- Get a piggy back ride\n- Bride&#39;s choice (x2)\n\n\u2665 Are your paper goods sustainably produced?\nYes! We love the earth, and want to keep it beautiful and green! All of our paper goodies are mindfully printed with soy-based inks on paper made from sustainably harvested trees so you can feel good about what you&#39;re ordering.","policy_seller_info":"","policy_updated_tsz":1474490198,"policy_has_private_receipt_info":false,"vacation_autoreply":"Hello, and thank-you for visiting Inklings Paperie! \r\n\r\nWe are currently closed the week of May 7th as we welcome a new little bundle into our family.
