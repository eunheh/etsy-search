The leather has a cross-grain textured design. \n\nEvery detail was thought through and its simplicity is the perfect pairing to the Apple watch design. It has a cut-out on the back of the watch to allow the heart rate sensor to remain in contact with the wrist. There are three separate pieces that connect to each other and to the watch. Very easy to attach to your watch. \n\nVery easy to attach. No tools necessary.  Limited supply.\n\nOnly the band is for sale; it does not include the Apple Watch.\n\nCONTACT ME if you have any questions.

As far as I am aware, this hardware is the closest color match to the Apple sport watch gold case. Please see the listings of this band with gold hardware in the APPLE BANDS l GOLD section of my shop.\n\nROSE GOLD - The rose gold hardware has a shiny finish, not brushed rose like the Apple sport watch. The rose gold hardware on this band is a true rose gold. The Apple sport rose gold case is a metallic rose, so it is NOT a perfect color match. However, once it&#39;s on your wrist, the color difference is not very noticeable. As far as I am aware, this hardware is the closest color match to the Apple sport watch rose gold case. Please see the listings of this band with rose gold hardware in the APPLE BANDS l ROSE GOLD section of my shop.\n\nSPACE GRAY - The space gray hardware is slightly lighter than the space gray Apple watch case. Please see the listings of this band with space gray hardware in the APPLE BANDS l SPACE GRAY section of my shop.\n\n\u2796PLEASE SELECT YOUR HARDWARE COLOR WHEN YOU PURCHASE\u2796\n\n\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38BAND DIMENSIONS\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38\n\nLARGE CUFF \n(comes with 42mm adapters)\n\nFits 150mm to 192mm wrists\n\nLength when fully extended (excludes hardware): 9.5 inches (251 mm)\nLength of cuff leather: 5.5 inches (140 mm) \nStrap Width: 0.75 inches (19 mm)\n\nSMALL \/ MEDIUM CUFF \n(comes with 38mm adapters)\n\nFits 145mm to 188mm wrists\n\nLength when fully extended (excludes hardware): 9.5 inches (251 mm)\nLength of cuff leather: 5.5 inches (140 mm) \nStrap Width: 0.63 inches (16 mm)\n\nMORE ABOUT SIZING:\nIf your wrist is smaller or larger, please convo me.

Then you will be given mailing instructions and after I get the item back, and have inspected it, I will &#39;Reserve,&#39; your chosen exchange item, with Your, (buyer&#39;s,) name on it, and put it on the last page of the shop. The buyer will have one week to return the unwanted item, in which case I should receive it within two weeks, (after Christmas.) After it has been inspected, and seen that it has not been damaged, I will contact you, (through Etsy only.) Then we can work out the details of the exchange, (incase the item you want is more expensive.) I will make a listing for the extra amount, for you to purchase, after which, I will send you the alternate item. Also note, Shipping Charges are Not refundable, and you will be charged for them on the new choice.\n\n Keeping in mind that most items are OOAK, (One Of A Kind,) get a Jump on the HOLIDAY RUSH....and use coupon code: FREESHIP50, at checkout for any order of $50+, (US only,) and 10% OFF any order of $100+ with coupon code: BEHAPPY, (including Sale items!)

Seller notes are based on opinion and are provided for guidance only. The pictures provided are a part of the description and detail any possible damage, not noted.  Antique, and Vintage jewelry should not be expected to be perfect, and will usually show wear, tarnish, or imperfections commensurate with age.  Please view the pictures for detail. Weights and gold value&#39;s stated are Approximate and not guaranteed, this includes stones etc., in the weight. Age stated in the title and descriptions are opinion based on sellers experience & is in no way guaranteed to be such.

Every item purchased is Gift Boxed, and mailed, first class, insured, ASAP, (usually within 24 hours,)  unless a shipping upgrade is purchased.\n \nAbout Welo Opals\n&#39;Ethiopian Welo\/Wello Opal is a relatively new find and rapidly gaining popularity. It has some of the most amazing patterns of any opal, and plays of color that reflect shades of light seen nowhere else in the natural world. Anybody who loves opals I would urge to give this gem a chance. It is easy to become mesmerized by its unique beauty. Because of the hydrophane property of this opal it can become crystal clear when saturated in water and as it dries it will turn completely opaque, and then slowly return to a crystal\/ semi-crystal state as it completely dries out which can take anywhere from a few days to several months. Over that time you can watch the opal slowly reveal new patterns or plays of color, sometimes gaining colors, and sometimes colors change or fade away. Because opal is not one of the hardest stones, ( only six on the scale of 10,) it is not recommended to be worn everyday, in the form of a ring, and NEVER put your hands in bleach or harsh detergent when wearing your ring.  This will, most likely, cause permanent damage.  And, don&#39;t forget, most swimming pools water is filtered with chlorine, (bleach.) to kill bacteria.  It is not friendly to jewelry either.\n\n5 STAR Reviews are Greatly appreciated !....1 star reviews with fictional  remarks, (because you were not pandered too, are not.)\n\nIf an issue arises, please make CONTACT thru the shop only, (NOT by review or e-mail,) so it can be addressed asap.\n\nPlease be aware, this shop does NO RESIZING of  rings, but many rings are adjustable, and most are resizable by any local jeweler, (for around $10.00, on Silver, from what I hear, but of course, that depends on the jeweler. )  \n\nUnfortunately the photography doesn&#39;t  capture the natural beauty, color and sparkle of many of the gemstones and crystals, (especially the opals,)  but when you see them in person, you will not be dissappointed.\n\nEvery Item is meticulasly packaged, and mailed out, first class, insured, the same day, when possable, Via USPS, to arrive at your door ASAP.  Normally  allow 2 to 5 business days,( in the USA,) if paid by credit card, and 6 to 10 days, on international orders, depending on destination, (not withstanding any possible delays, due to customs, or natural disasters, such as floods, hurricanes, volcano eruptions, etc.)\n\nEvery domestic order over $15 is insured thru etsy, and tracking can be seen by clicking on the &#39;YOU,&#39; icon, top, right, and then click &#39;Purchases & Reviews.&#39;  No insurance can be provided on International orders, as the cost is prohibative, and the USPS will not cover loss of items once they&#39;ve left our boarders.  So International orders are at your own risk.  However, there have been no losses to date.  \n\nCustoms numbers are provided upon request, on International orders, to help retrieve your parcel, should there be a hold up, as International orders may possably experience a delay during heavy postal seasons, due to customs.  Your local post office can contact them for you, if you provide them with the Customs #&#39;s, and this usually speeds things up.","currency_code":"USD","is_vacation":false,"vacation_message":"Happy Holidays and Merry Christmas !

One side of the pin has teeth, so just do a few small taps, and if you see the teeth, keep tapping.

Normally, Vintage or Antique items are sold &#39;As Is&#39;, (non-returnable,) Unless purchased as a Christmas Gift, only than, it can be Exchanged, by the purchaser only, and only if the shop is notified, (thru the shop,) within 3 days after Christmas, (buy the buyer,) at which time, you should be able to tell me which item you think you would like to exchange for. Then you will be given mailing instructions and after I get the item back, and have inspected it, I will &#39;Reserve,&#39; your chosen exchange item, with Your, (buyer&#39;s,) name on it, and put it on the last page of the shop. The buyer will have one week to return the unwanted item, in which case I should receive it within two weeks, (after Christmas.) After it has been inspected, and seen that it has not been damaged, I will contact you, (through Etsy only.) Then we can work out the details of the exchange, (incase the item you want is more expensive.) I will make a listing for the extra amount, for you to purchase, after which, I will send you the alternate item. Also note, Shipping Charges are Not refundable, and you will be charged for them on the new choice.\n\n Keeping in mind that most items are OOAK, (One Of A Kind,) get a Jump on the HOLIDAY RUSH....and use coupon code: FREESHIP50, at checkout for any order of $50+, (US only,) and 10% OFF any order of $100+ with coupon code: BEHAPPY, (including Sale items!)

There is a layaway plan for Christmas tho, so if you want to take advantage of it, let me know, via Etsy-mail, and I will give you the info.\n\nIn all cases, prospective buyers are responsible for determining the physical condition of items from the Highly Magnified Photos in the listing, and the printed conditions in the description.  Seller notes are based on opinion and are provided for guidance only. The pictures provided are a part of the description and detail any possible damage, not noted.  Antique, and Vintage jewelry should not be expected to be perfect, and will usually show wear, tarnish, or imperfections commensurate with age.  Please view the pictures for detail. Weights and gold value&#39;s stated are Approximate and not guaranteed, this includes stones etc., in the weight. Age stated in the title and descriptions are opinion based on sellers experience & is in no way guaranteed to be such.  Highly magnified photos are provided and any visible, (by eye,) flaws are described in listing.  They are returnable for exchange only, and under certain circumstances, such as,  if the shop is contacted, promptly upon receipt.  Just be honest about it.  If authorization is given to make an exchange, on a Vintage or Antique item, or a refund on a New, Hand Crafted item, instructions will be given regarding shipping of the return.   \n\nCustom Orders are Welcome.  If you would like to specify colors of Swarovski crystals, etc. on a hand made item, you are under no obligation to purchase it.  If it is requested within 2 months of Christmas, a small deposit may be required, but will be deducted from the price when you purchase it.  \nIf you decide not to purchase your custom piece, your deposit will not be refunded.\n\nFind Super Sales throughout the Shop!  &#39;PS&#39; on listings means &#39;Price Slashed.&#39;   All items, after the 1st item SHIP FREE, (on domestic orders.)  Every item purchased is Gift Boxed, and mailed, first class, insured, ASAP, (usually within 24 hours,)  unless a shipping upgrade is purchased.\n \nAbout Welo Opals\n&#39;Ethiopian Welo\/Wello Opal is a relatively new find and rapidly gaining popularity. It has some of the most amazing patterns of any opal, and plays of color that reflect shades of light seen nowhere else in the natural world. Anybody who loves opals I would urge to give this gem a chance. It is easy to become mesmerized by its unique beauty. Because of the hydrophane property of this opal it can become crystal clear when saturated in water and as it dries it will turn completely opaque, and then slowly return to a crystal\/ semi-crystal state as it completely dries out which can take anywhere from a few days to several months. Over that time you can watch the opal slowly reveal new patterns or plays of color, sometimes gaining colors, and sometimes colors change or fade away. Because opal is not one of the hardest stones, ( only six on the scale of 10,) it is not recommended to be worn everyday, in the form of a ring, and NEVER put your hands in bleach or harsh detergent when wearing your ring.  This will, most likely, cause permanent damage.  And, don&#39;t forget, most swimming pools water is filtered with chlorine, (bleach.) to kill bacteria.  It is not friendly to jewelry either.\n\n5 STAR Reviews are Greatly appreciated !....1 star reviews with fictional  remarks, (because you were not pandered too, are not.)\n\nIf an issue arises, please make CONTACT thru the shop only, (NOT by review or e-mail,) so it can be addressed asap.\n\nPlease be aware, this shop does NO RESIZING of  rings, but many rings are adjustable, and most are resizable by any local jeweler, (for around $10.00, on Silver, from what I hear, but of course, that depends on the jeweler. )  \n\nUnfortunately the photography doesn&#39;t  capture the natural beauty, color and sparkle of many of the gemstones and crystals, (especially the opals,)  but when you see them in person, you will not be dissappointed.\n\nEvery Item is meticulasly packaged, and mailed out, first class, insured, the same day, when possable, Via USPS, to arrive at your door ASAP.  Normally  allow 2 to 5 business days,( in the USA,) if paid by credit card, and 6 to 10 days, on international orders, depending on destination, (not withstanding any possible delays, due to customs, or natural disasters, such as floods, hurricanes, volcano eruptions, etc.)\n\nEvery domestic order over $15 is insured thru etsy, and tracking can be seen by clicking on the &#39;YOU,&#39; icon, top, right, and then click &#39;Purchases & Reviews.&#39;  No insurance can be provided on International orders, as the cost is prohibative, and the USPS will not cover loss of items once they&#39;ve left our boarders.  So International orders are at your own risk.  However, there have been no losses to date.  \n\nCustoms numbers are provided upon request, on International orders, to help retrieve your parcel, should there be a hold up, as International orders may possably experience a delay during heavy postal seasons, due to customs.  Your local post office can contact them for you, if you provide them with the Customs #&#39;s, and this usually speeds things up.","currency_code":"USD","is_vacation":false,"vacation_message":"Happy Holidays and Merry Christmas !

If an item gets lost by the post office, (very rare,) and you have provided the correct address AND zip code, we will assist you in tracking it down. If it is not recovered, you can assist us in filing an insurance claim, and your item will be replaced or refunded, as soon as the insurance pays.  We now insure all orders over $15.00, just to be safe.  If your item is under $15.00, and tracking proves you did not receive it, we will send you another one, if it is available, if not, you can pick out another item of comprable or slightly higher value.\r\n\r\nWe display magnified photos of the item you will receive, and when possible use a model, so that you can see how they will look on the body.
